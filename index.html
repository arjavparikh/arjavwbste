                                 Arjav is a confused engineering student not into engineering. He is into start ups, social service and film making. Considering humor as a primary ingredient of life he has his own production house which makes short films based on humor. His aim behind this is to spread as many smiles as he can. He is very well connected among start ups and also helped in setting up an incubation cell in an institute in Ahmedabad. Other than that Arjav believes in pure sciences and self learning.

                                The Media Lab India Initiative is an effort by students and alumni from the MIT Media Lab to bring together a community of makers and creators across India, and to facilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas across boundaries of disciplines, institutions and culture. The goal is to create an environment much like at the MIT Media Lab, an environment that fosters creative exploration of ideas.

                                Over the past four years, MIT Media Lab India Initiative organized four workshops in Pune, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Bangalore. Each five-day workshop brings together hundreds of students with backgrounds in art, science, technology and design to collaborate in teams and to come up with prototypes and design concepts, which are showcased in an open house at the end of the workshop. Each workshop consists of a number of tracks or focus areas, conducted by two instructors from the Media Lab who guide about 50 students through the process of observing, brainstorming, and prototyping.less

                                I was the organizer of the Ahmedabad workshop which was from 16th January 2015 to 23 January 2015. <br>

                                Teaching a kid how to speak, in Kindergarten, is equally difficult as teaching a kid the basics of electronics, in 6th grade. Today, a lot of educational systems continue enforcing a cliched style of introducing new topics, which fail to hook the student to a subject, blocking their creativity. While some schools, incorporate new methods of teaching to push creativity in students at young age, they fail to continue doing so when students move to higher grades.

                                We believe that if this gap is bridged, we will have students in high school who are better preapred for the global economy. Therefore, we created the CircuiTricks kit, which introduces a physics topic in a different manner, such that the students' creativity stays preserved!<br>

                                <h3>India Film Project [2014 - Present] </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Started as an intern I have been associated with the team till now.
                                    India Film Project is Asia's largest online and on-ground competition which encourages a film buff to make a film over the weekend, away from your huff-buff schedule, and showcase it to people around and get awarded.<br>

                                    With IFP I started my journey as an intern and had always been a support whenever needed. Gradually I merged more into the team and started helping in various aspects of the project. My major contribution remains in managing the flow of the project. <br>
                                    
                                    This year (2016) more than 15000 filmakerfs from 700 plus teams participated, every year the participation increases. To figure out an efficient way for the registration process, communication channel as well as the film submissions is a task. I designed a very systematic solution using many different tools for the same. <br>

                                    A glimpse of the process I designed has been penned down below:

                                    <ul>
                                    <li> Registration process was shifted from "Google Forms" to custom made registration form on the website which was linked to a SQL database. </li>
                                    <li> An excel sheet was updated at regular intervals from the database to add new participants who register. This sheet was useful to the communication team.</li>
                                    <li> For communication with the participants SMS and bulk emailers were used.</li>
                                    <li> The films were accepted over "Airdrop" which was link to an email ID. A script was written to automatically start download from Airdrop as soon as a film was received. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                <h3>MIT Media Labs India Initiative [Volunteer| January 2014] </h3>
                                <p>
                                    The Media Lab India Initiative is an effort by students and alumni from the MIT Media Lab to bring together a community of makers and creators across India, and to facilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas across boundaries of disciplines, institutions and culture. The goal is to create an environment much like at the MIT Media Lab, an environment that fosters creative exploration of ideas.

                                    Over the past four years, MIT Media Lab India Initiative organized four workshops in Pune, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Bangalore. Each five-day workshop brings together hundreds of students with backgrounds in art, science, technology and design to collaborate in teams and to come up with prototypes and design concepts, which are showcased in an open house at the end of the workshop. Each workshop consists of a number of tracks or focus areas, conducted by two instructors from the Media Lab who guide about 50 students through the process of observing, brainstorming, and prototyping. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I was the organizer of the Ahmedabad workshop which was from 16th January 2015 to 23 January 2015.<br>

                                <p>
                                    The Project Cafe is a young fresh initiative to bring together the spirit of art, functionality, business, food and drink. As a part of the internship at The Project Cafe I was associated with the communications.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    My work included:
                                    <li>Communicating with external entities about the cafe as and when needed. </li>
                                    <li>Give inputs in social media strategies for the cafe. </li>
                                    <li>Research about the cafe as a part of experimental marketing to get good analytics in opening the cafe in other cities. </li>
                                    <li>Curate and approach various communities or artists and bring them on board to the cafe involving some sort of activity. </li>
                                    <li>I also designed a huge sign for the cafe using my projection mapping skills so that it is visible from the nearby road. 
                                    </li>
                                    </ul>

                                <h3>Circuitricks [2014-2015] </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Teaching a kid how to speak, in Kindergarten, is equally difficult as teaching a kid the basics of electronics, in 6th grade. Today, a lot of educational systems continue enforcing a cliched style of introducing new topics, which fail to hook the student to a subject, blocking their creativity. <br>

                                    While some schools, incorporate new methods of teaching to push creativity in students at young age, they fail to continue doing so when students move to higher grades. We believe that if this gap is bridged, we will have students in high school who are better preapred for the global economy. Therefore, we created the CircuiTricks kit, which introduces a physics topic in a different manner, such that the students' creativity stays preserved!<br>

                                    Circuitricks was in initiative by my friends Sohil Patel and Nirman Dave where I helped them in various concept and strategy design aspects. After the concept was ready we all handeled different aspects of the project. My major field of work included:
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Making strategies about taking up this project to schools. </li>
                                    <li>Designing an action plan for allocating and coordination with volunteers associated with this project. </li>
                                    <li>Teaching kids about electronics. </li>
                                    <li>Teaching kids about the concept of circuitricks.</li>
                                    <li>Making the kinds learn about the new innovation done at circuitricks. </li>
                                    <li>Encouraging students to pursue design thinking from a very young age. </li>
                                    <li>Teach tutorials from the circuitricks kit provided to school kids. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    More information about circuitricks is availabe on the website.

                                <p>
                                    Spandan Club is an activity club started by some enthusiastic people. Every Saturday volunteers of this group go to a school named "Hira Laxmi Banker Viklang Vidhya Mandir" and teach the students things apart from their curriculum. As a part of the group I helped students learn English. All the students in the school are handicapped and they do not come from a finincially stable background. <br>

                                    My duties: 
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Interact with the students in English language. </li>
                                    <li>Teach them basic life skills. </li>
                                    <li>Try to share views and reflections about the world. </li>
                                    <li>Motivate the students to become a good leader in life. </li>
                                    <li>Twice a year we gather funds from donors and plan a trip for the students to explore various parts of the city. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br>

                                    This activity gives me much peace and helps me feel good about me. Unfortunatelly they do not have any internet presence but if you want to know more about it then you can definitely contact me.

                                <p>
                                    This activity was undertaken for Intel's intervention in indonesia. <br><br>

                                    <b>Problem:</b> Indonesia is a country which has more than 18000 islands. Setting up of labs everywhere adds a lot to the expenditure. Moreover the country is not ecnomically stable to setup labs and provide latest education to their population. <br><br>

                                    <b>Solution:</b> We designed a MIW (Mobile innovation workstation) which is a suitcase consisting of basic fabrication and electronic tools. The suitcase also has manuals on how to use the tools. Moreover five activity specially designed keeping indonesia's problems in mind are added to bring conciousness among the children. <br><br>

                                    There is a necessasity to set up a lab at one place now which can act as a base station. Volunteers can travel to different islands and educate the children there. It becomes very easy to transport the tools to different places. 
                                    <br><br>

                                    The MIW was inaugurated by Hon'ble governer of indonesia Mr. XYZ <br><br>

                                <p>
                                    The Kermit Project was started as an initiative to promote offline discussions where participants from a vast number of backgrounds gather and discuss. Slowly as days passsed the aim got narrowed down to a new theme everytime. Hence it became an offline forum for theme based discussions. <br></p>

                                    <p>I pursued the kermit project as my own start up along with my studies. A lot of people suggested me various revenue models for this. I never ever thought about a revenue model as I loved doing it. Unfortunately due to lack of time this project had to be stopped 3 years. It was started on 28 July 2013 and we ended it on 28 July 2016. 
                                    <br></p>

                                    <p>Through it's journey people from a lot of different fields participated. The highest participation we had once was 80 participants. The soul purpose of such an initiative was to have a grassroot networking plaform from folks of all backgrounds. 
                                    <br></p>

                                    <p>The Kermit Project will always remain one of the very important projects in my life where I learned a majority of my lessons.

                                <p>
                                    "Machines Around Us" is a book I authored. </p>
                                    <p>
                                    You see a lot of new things around you daily. It also happens that you interact with them often and use them. But, most of the times you never wonder how they work and do not bother even. All these things have basic science mechanisms behind them which you never bother to think about. These concepts if known well helps you to look that the daily objects with a different perspective. Such concepts if understood well helps a kid to tinker more.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Machines Around Us is one such concept which explains about the basic physics behind the objects found around. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    The book was launched on 23 January 2016 at Makerfest in CEPT University of Ahmedabad. The entire book is conceptualized, written and designed by me. Saiprema Tiwari, a friend of mine helped me to make the beautiful illustrations in the book. Samip Mistry suggested me the layout for the same. Sohil Patel, helped me to actually publish my book. I would be thankful to all of them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    The book is available on Amazon India. Already 900+ copies of the book has already been sold and I am hoping that it reaches more people.

                                    With Machines Around Us I wish to enhance the creativity behind the thinking of the kids and their inclination towards the reason behind daily machines.

                                    This was an effort in collaboration with a fashion designer friend of mine. We managed to create a collection which had the combination of "High fashion" and "Wearable electronics". The end product were stunning garments which we also wore to some parties for consumer feedback and people loved it.</p>

                                    <p>
                                    Project Luminati is an amalgamation of fashion and technology which strives to create affordable e-textiles to utilize for entertainment, advertisement and special occasions. Luminati aims to construct a very wide variety of garments which can be used for a large number of uses.

                                    Things around us is not just another concept, but also and attempt to encourage everyone around us to create more. Under this project I wish to encourage kids more and more towards emphasising on basic science behind day to day things. I wish to execute this in the form of books, android apps and toys.                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I have already published a book named "Machines Around Us" under this title which is a childrens book on physics. My upcoming project is "Elements Around Us" which would be a book on Chemistry. I want to bring it up as a series of books which includes topics such as Biology, Maths and Electronics as well.

                                <p>
                                    Seva Café is an experiment in the shared joy that comes from humble giving and selfless service. The wholesome meals are cooked and served with love by volunteers and offered to guests as a genuine gift, for which they are free to pay from their heart. This goes towards cooking the next days meals, and so the chain has continued for more than 10 years. It is an initiative supported entirely by the community, in an effort to connect with our peers.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                    It is this exchange of thought that can help bring about an understanding of those around us. For example, I may work with a woman empowerment organization, but I might understand my work better if I spend an evening cooking food with an 'underprivileged' woman. 

                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                    I have been a regular volunteer at this place since last 6 years. A typical day at seva cafe starts with a prayer followed by allotment of chores. May it be cooking, washing dishes or serving, it gives the best feeling ever. The positive atmosphere over there motivates you more and more. You end your days with sharing meals with other volunteers and talking to them. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                    This place has played an important part in making me what I am today.

                                <h3>Exploring Projection Mapping</h3>
                                <p>
                                    As you can see in the images it appears to be some cool t-shirt. 

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Well, this could have not been possible without projection mapping technology. This was my final year project for my Engineering in 2015. Tinkering with this technology was my project but I eventually created something very interesting out of this. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    I created something to use Projection Mapping in visual merchandising for stores. Visual Merchandising is required in almost all the garment stores. With my creation it becomes quite easy to demonstrate all the garments speedily. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Using the traditional methods creating a mapping on a mannequin was quite difficult, but I figured out a way. It took me quite sometime to figure out the process but the end product was very interesting. The image below explains the process I designed.                                   
                                </p>

                                    "Takleef Toh Rehvani" was started as a youtube prank channel. As a part of it we used to pranks on random people and publish the videos on youtube.

                                    Slowly and gradually we started taking film editing and marketing projects under this domain. Our major contribution was to Niket Productions where we were a part of several films.

                                    A thousand eyes is an electronic garment I am currently making (as on 1 December 2016)  for a fashion show in Canada. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                          
                                The garment takes its colour story from the vibrant peacock colours.
                                Furthur more the prints and the danglers are an inspiration from peacocks feathers and the way the open up during rains. The light effects on the surface would further add to the peacock’s shimmering resembelance.
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                The fabric used the garment would be majorly viscose or dual tone silk to achieve the natural shimmering effect of a peacock’s body while maintaining a soft appearance. The shoulder pieces and danglers would be backed with buckrum or high density fusing to provide a stiff appearance. LED would be incorporated by creating sections and piping on the insides of the garment, they would further be backed by foam layers or other mediums to give the LEDs a diffusing effect. The surface will consist of ornamentation techniques such as digital prints and some handworked areas by artisans.
                                </p>

An initiative by the youth of India to make our country a better place to live in

The utmost brutality and inhumanity of the numerous rape cases in India has shaken us all to our very core. We blame the police, the government, and the shameless by-passers who ignored such heinous acts and didn’t even lift a finger to help those innocent souls. Some of us even blame the victims, criticizing their dressing or their timing or even their attitude! We claim that we know better, we claim to be on the victim’s side, we claim to fight for justice.

1.  Teams from all the colleges (Irrespective of their fields) from all over Gujarat can be a part of this good cause.

2.  There should be only 1 team from each college. (Interested students can consult each other and work together)

3.  The participant team will be given a time duration of1 month to complete 15 tasks that will be given to them.

4.   The judgement will be based on the effect or outcome of the task performed by the team.

5.  There will be 1 team leader who will lead the team and will be in direct contact with the KOSHISH organizer.
